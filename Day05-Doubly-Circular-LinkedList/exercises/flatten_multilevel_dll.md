# Flatten Multilevel Doubly Linked List

## Problem
Each node has next, prev, and child pointers. Flatten the list so that all nodes appear in a single level.

## Input
- Head of a multilevel doubly linked list

## Output
- Head of the flattened list

## Constraints
- Up to 10^5 nodes

## Hint
- Use a stack to simulate DFS traversal.
