## 🚀 Why This Repository?

Data Structures and Algorithms form the backbone of computer science and technical interviews.  
This 30‑day pathway helps you:

- Build strong fundamentals  
- Implement all major data structures from scratch  
- Understand algorithmic thinking  
- Practice interview‑level problems  
- Strengthen your C programming skills  
- Become confident for placements and coding rounds  

Each day includes:
- Concept explanation  
- Clean example programs  
- Exercises for practice  
- Fully solved solutions  
- Interview‑focused problems
