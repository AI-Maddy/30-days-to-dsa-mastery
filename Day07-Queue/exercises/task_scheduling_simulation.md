# Task Scheduling Simulation (Challenge)

## Problem
Simulate a single-core CPU scheduling tasks in FIFO order. Each task has an ID and a duration. Output completion times.

## Input
- Integer n
- n pairs of (task_id, duration)

## Output
- Completion time for each task in input order

## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 10^5

## Hint
- Use a queue and keep a running current time.
