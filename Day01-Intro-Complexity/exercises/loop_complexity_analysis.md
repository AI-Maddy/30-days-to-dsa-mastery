# Loop Complexity Analysis (Challenge)

## Problem
Analyze the time complexity of the following loop patterns:

1) Single loop from 0 to n-1
2) Nested loop where inner loop starts at i
3) Loop that doubles i each iteration
4) Loop that halves n each iteration

## Output
- Provide the Big-O time complexity for each pattern.

## Hint
- Translate the number of iterations into a summation.
